# zombie.py

# Declare a Zombie class that accepts health and brains_eaten parameters. 

# In the initialization process for an object, assign the two parameters to two attributes with the same name.
# If the instantiation does not pass a health parameter, it should be assigned a default value of 100.
# If the instantiation does not pass a brains_eaten parameter, it should be assigned a default value of 5.

# Instantiate a Zombie object with 80 health and 5 brains eaten. Assign it to a “bob” variable.
# Instantiate a Zombie object with  3 brains eaten. Assign it to a “sally” variable.
# Instantiate a Zombie object with no custom parameters. Assign it to a “benjamin” variable.

# Practice instantiating the objects with both positional and keyword arguments.
