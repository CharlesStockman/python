# Declare a Newspaper class. 

# Each Newspaper will have a 'pages' attribute set to an integer and a 'sections' 
# attribute set to a dictionary.  

# The keys in 'sections' will be strings representing a section (i.e. "Politics") 
# and the values will be the starting page for that section (i.e. "A5").

# The length of a newspaper should be equal to the number of pages it holds.

# Indexing the newspaper by a section should return the starting 
# page for that section.

# Make it so two newspapers are considered equal if they have the same number of 
# pages AND the same number of sections

#
# A Tuple to contain the information about each seciton of a news page
#

# EXAMPLE:
monday_sections = {
  "Politics": "A5",
  "Sports": "B2",
  "Entertainment": "C3"
}

tuesday_sections = {
  "Travel": "A5",
  "Cooking": "B2",
}

wednesday_sections = {
  "Classifieds": "A5",
  "Weddings": "B2",
  "Weather": "C3"
}
