# Define a Car class that accepts a maker (string), model (string),
# and year (number) attributes and assigns them to respective
# attributes

# Define a Dealership class. Each Dealership object should instantiate
# with a "cars" attribute set to an empty list.

# A Dealership object should have a accept_delivery instance method
# that accepts a Car object and adds it to the Dealership's internal
# "cars" list

# Indexing into a Dealership with a number should access a specific
# Car object in the Dealership.

# An index position in a Dealership should also be overwriteable
# with a new Car object (see examples below)
