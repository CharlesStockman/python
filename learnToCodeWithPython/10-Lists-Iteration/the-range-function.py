# Declare a sum_from function that accepts two numbers as 
# arguments.  The second number will always be greater than 
# the first number.  The function should return the sum of 
# all numbers from the first number to the second number 
# (inclusive).
#
# sum_from(1, 2)   # 1 + 2 => 3
# sum_from(1, 5)   # 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
# sum_from(3, 8)   # 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 => 33
# sum_from(9, 12)  # 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 => 42
