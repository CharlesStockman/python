#Define a fizzbuzz function that accepts a single number as an argument. The function should print every number from 1 to that argument. 
#There are a couple caveats.
#If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
#If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
#If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
#If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, just print the number.
