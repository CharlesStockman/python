# Define a factorial function that accepts a single number
# A factorial represents the product of all numbers up to, and including, that number. For example, 5 factorial is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
# Return the factorial from your function. You should NOT use any kind of loops. Instead, utilize recursion. Your function MUST call itself.
